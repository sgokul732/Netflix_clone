**About the Project**

This was a 2 day long, 2 page project built during the online assessment of Software and Design skills. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the tv-maze API based on what they were interested in, such as &#39;show season name&#39;. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router-5.2.0 and redux.

.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 5.2.0, Redux, bootstrap 4.5.3, axios, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes
